Selenium is a powerful web scraping tool developed originally for website testing.
These days, it’s also used when the accurate portrayal of websites—as they appear in a
browser—is required. Selenium works by automating browsers to load the website,
retrieve the required data, and even take screenshots or assert that certain actions
happen on the website.
The Selenium library is an API called on the object
WebDriver. The WebDriver is a
bit like a browser in that it can load websites, but it can also be used like a Beauti
fulSoup object to find page elements, interact with elements on the page (send text,
click, etc.), and do other actions to drive the web scrapers
